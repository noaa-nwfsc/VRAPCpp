# VRAPS
R package for VRAP rewrite

### To install

```
library(devtools)
#tell devtools build only for your machine: 32- or 64-bit
#needed because C++ code in the VRAP 2.0 package
options(devtools.install.args = "--no-multiarch")
#VRAP 2.0
install_github("eeholmes/VRAPCpp")
#VRAP 1.0
install_github("eeholmes/VRAP")
```

The vignettes in the package are not built by default as that would take a long time.  If you want them built add `build_vignettes = TRUE` to the `install_github` call.  However, the normal procedure for a package is for the package developer to build the vignettes locally and then put the Rmd and html (from knit) files in the `inst/doc` folder which will then get uploaded to github.

To build all the vignettes in the `vignette` folder in the package and put the files into `inst/doc`.  Use

```
#note "." must be the base level of the package for this to work.
require(devtools)
build_vignettes()
```

Or knit the vignette and manually move the html file and Rmd file into the `inst/doc` folder.

## Vignettes

The package has vignettes that discuss the background of VRAP and show how to use it.  To view the vignettes available use:
```
browseVignettes(package="VRAPS")
```
You can open a vignette rmarkdown file using
```
vignette_rmd_file = "Background.Rmd"
fpath <- system.file("doc", vignette_rmd_file, package="VRAPS")
file.open(fpath)
```

## Notes

* Parameters that mean the same thing in VRAP 1.0 and VRAP 2.0 have the same name.
* The exception is 'prod' and 'cap' used instead of 'BSRa' and 'BSRb' since 'prod' and 'cap' are easier to understand and used in DM.
* The "Buffer" jargon from VRAP 1.0 is removed since VRAP 2.0 uses ER/Pop start and end with a specified step size.  The VRAP 2.0 terms are StepSize, StepStart, StepEnd and StepNum.  However in rav files, the step size, start and end are defined as a fraction of base ER or Pop capacity to keep the VRAP 2.0 and VRAP 1.0 rav files the same.
* StepNum in VRAP 2.0 and BufMax in VRAP 2.0 are both the total number of target ERs (or Pops) simulations.  It is not "total - 1" (as in Martin's first draft of VRAP 2.0 code).  

## to do 

* Martin: Add totAEQmort to RunSims2C().  I have defined at top.  But simFish() needs to be altered to return it.  See changes to RunSims2R().

* I did not do the BYHR SummaryStats.  I wasn't sure anyone used them and didn't want to add a bunch more code.

## Running a demo of the VRAP 1.0 emmulation

```
setwd("vignette_files")
out = Main.VRAP1("tmp.rav")
out = Main.VRAP1("tmp.rav", version="C")
```
That will run `tmp.rav` through Main.VRAP1() and make all the VRAP 1.0 output files.  Note, Martin needs to add totAEQmort to `simFish()` before this will run.
